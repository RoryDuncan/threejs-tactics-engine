  Stages is an object to manage, well, stages.
  which a stage is the equivalent to the game concept of a 'level.'
  but someone could use multiple stages in one level, so I don't want to be pushy and call it a 'level' manager

    Helper class for selecting objects / entities from a grid

  filterData: (vec3) ->

    ###
      argument 'vec3' can be an object or a THREE.Vector3 instance
      ! Vector3 instances don't allow you to have 'undefined' as a value, so using '*' is used
      ie:   filterData( new THREE.Vector3(0, "*", "*") );

      Plain objects do allow undefined though, so you can pass in an object with all the values you want
      ie:   filterData({ x: 2});
